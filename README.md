### 

A tool for designing, visualizing and optimizing defensive structures for Minecraft faction gameplay and anarchy servers like 2b2t.

## Minecraft Faction Defense Visualizer

This project helps players design robust defensive structures for survival Minecraft servers with a focus on faction warfare and raid defense. Using an interactive 3D viewer, players can create, test, and export defensive builds optimized against common raiding techniques.

### üõ°Ô∏è Key Features

1. **Defensive Structure Generation** - Create obsidian bunkers, trapped walls, and TNT-resistant designs
2. **Vulnerability Analysis** - Identify weak points in your defenses against TNT cannons and withers
3. **Raid Simulation** - Test your defenses against common attack patterns used in faction raids
4. **2b2t-Ready Designs** - Specialized templates for surviving in anarchy server environments
5. **Interactive 3D Preview** - Examine and modify your defenses from all angles before building
6. **Defense Layer Planning** - Design multi-layered defenses with spawn traps, redstone systems and more

### üî• Specialized for Faction Warfare

- **Wither-Proof Rooms** - Create chambers that protect valuable items from wither destruction
- **Water/Lava Curtain Systems** - Design advanced liquid defense systems
- **TNT Cannon Resistant Walls** - Optimize wall designs against faction raiding techniques
- **Trap Design** - Create elaborate traps to catch raiders off-guard
- **Resource Optimization** - Get the best protection with the fewest valuable resources

### üè† Technical Implementation

- **Three.js** for the 3D model viewer with proper Minecraft-style blocks
- **Custom CSS** for authentic Minecraft UI aesthetics
- **Defense Algorithm** that analyzes structural integrity against common attack vectors
- **Faction-specific optimizations** for different server types and ruleset

### üíé Inspired by Pandora's Vault

This project draws inspiration from the infamous Pandora's Vault prison on the Dream SMP, which exemplified advanced Minecraft defensive architecture. Like the legendary obsidian structure designed to be inescapable, our defense generator focuses on creating semi-permeable barriers that keep adversaries out while allowing authorized users in.

### üè∞ The Philosophy of Minecraft Defenses

Defending a Minecraft base, stronghold, or prison follows a consistent architectural philosophy: creating systems that function as semi-permeable barriers. These structures are designed to:

1. **Keep unwanted players out** - Using complex layers of obsidian, water/lava barriers, and redstone traps
2. **Allow authorized players in** - Through secret entrances, password systems, or redstone mechanisms
3. **Protect valuable resources** - With hidden chambers, obsidian vaults, and anti-wither defenses
4. **Survive against various attack types** - From TNT cannons to wither-based destruction

Our generator applies these principles to create defensively sound structures tailored to your specific server environment, whether it's faction warfare, anarchy servers like 2b2t, or SMP gameplay.
